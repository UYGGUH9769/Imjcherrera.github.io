   <p>My name is James Carl Herrera, a 19-year-old entrepreneur and multidisciplinary artist.
     I currently manage a small business and work professionally as an event stylist. In addition, I am a dedicated dancer
      and aspiring fashion model, with a strong passion for creative expression through movement, design, and craftsmanship.
       As an emerging artisan, I continually seek opportunities to grow, innovate, and contribute meaningfully to the
        creative industries.</p>

       <p> I’m currently managing a small business in the arts and crafts industry, which I also consider my personal hobby. One of the things I truly enjoy is making bouquets, every time I create one, my heart feels full and happy. Each bouquet I make is not just a product, but a piece of art crafted with care and passion. To expand on this, I’m exploring ideas like creating themed bouquet collections based on seasons, emotions, or special occasions. I also plan to offer DIY kits and host workshops to share the joy of bouquet-making with others. In the future, I’d love to launch a subscription or gift box service, so more people can regularly experience the warmth and creativity that goes into every piece.</p>
